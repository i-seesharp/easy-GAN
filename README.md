# Generating and Analyzing Images on a Limited Budget

This is the repository for the research posted for the team of Aaranya Dev Barman and Sajjad Mirza.

The code above was written in Google Colab, and so the data directory would be need to changed to wherever the dataset is stored on your local machine.
The model was trained using CUDA on Colab GPU, so some bits of code might complain if you try to run it on a CPU.

## Models
The models folder contains the 4 different experiments described in the research paper.

## Images
The images folder contains a few sample images generated during the training process. Some images have been discarded, just to reduce the size of the repository but can very easily be regenrated by running the respecitive model.

## Dataset
Our dataset is too large to be pushed to GitHub, therefore the dataset can be found at the link:
